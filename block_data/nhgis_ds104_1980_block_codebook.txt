Data Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data file accompanying this codebook contains summary data for 1980 census
collection blocks derived from 1980 Summary Tape File 1 (STF1). The file
includes all tables available in STF1.

The original STF1 block data was provided only for parts of collection blocks, 
subdivided by the boundaries of places and minor civil divisions. NHGIS staff 
generated the data for whole collection blocks from the data for block parts.

NHGIS provides 1980 block data files for the entire nation and for individual
states and the District of Columbia.

State-level files include the two-digit state FIPS code in the file suffix to
indicate the state that serves as the spatial extent for a given file:

    FIPS STATE               FIPS STATE              FIPS STATE        
    01   Alabama             21   Kentucky           38   North Dakota
    02   Alaska              22   Louisiana          39   Ohio
    04   Arizona             23   Maine              40   Oklahoma
    05   Arkansas            24   Maryland           41   Oregon
    06   California          25   Massachusetts      42   Pennsylvania

NHGIS has created this version of 1980 block data to accompany the NHGIS 1980 
block boundaries. For more information on the 1980 block boundaries, see 
https://www.nhgis.org/1980-block-boundaries.

For an explanation of the motivation for these files and of the concept of 
"whole collection blocks," see 
https://www.nhgis.org/1980-block-boundaries#collection-blocks.

To generate data for whole collection blocks for each table, we sum the counts 
for all separate parts in each split block, producing totaled sums for each 
whole block. For tables that report median values, summing in this way is not
appropriate. Instead, for blocks that are split in the source 1980 STF1 data, we
estimate medians from corresponding binned count data from a different table. We
use this same method to compute medians for ALL blocks for Table NT44 (Median 
Contract  Rent) because the source values for NT44 are incorrect.

For more information on our approach for medians, see the section on Median 
Computation & Special Codes below.

We suppress data for whole collection blocks wherever the STF1 source data were
suppressed for any of the individual block parts that compose each whole block.
For more information, see the section on Suppression below.

Median Computation & Special Codes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Six tables in 1980 STF1 report median values. To produce statistics for whole
collection blocks for these tables, we estimate medians from corresponding 
binned count data from a different table. 

For instance, for table NT11A (Median Age), in cases where a single collection
block's population was split into multiple STF1 records, we estimate medians 
for the whole block from the binned counts in table NT10A (Age) after summing 
each binned count within each collection block.

Median tables in 1980 STF1 and the corresponding tables of binned counts:

   _MEDIAN_TABLE_                    _SOURCE_OF_BINNED_COUNTS_
   NT11A. Median Age                 NT10A. Age
   NT11B. Median Age by Sex          NT10B. Sex by Age
   NT31.  Median Rooms               NT30.  Rooms
   NT34.  Median Persons per Unit    NT33A. Persons in Unit
   NT39.  Median Value               NT38.  Value
   NT44.  Median Contract Rent       NT43.  Contract Rent

We use the median estimation method described in User Note No. 2 of the 1980 
STF1 Technical Documentation:

  https://assets.nhgis.org/original-data/modern-census/1980STF1.pdf#page=9 

When computing medians, the Census Bureau often uses count data that is grouped 
into narrower bins than those reported in 1980 STF1, producing a more precise 
median estimate. Therefore, for unsplit collection blocks and for split blocks 
that had nonzero counts in only a single split part, we retain the original 
median values reported in 1980 STF1.

As is also explained in User Note No. 2 (link above), the original values in 
table NT44 (Median Contract Rent) were incorrect for all blocks, so for that 
table, we interpolate from counts to generate corrected median values for ALL 
blocks, both split and unsplit.

The 1980 STF1 documentation suggests that medians were computed using Pareto 
interpolation in some cases, but this seemed inconsistent with the median values
reported. Therefore, in contrast to what is suggested in the 1980 STF1 
documentation, we use linear interpolation for all medians in this dataset. 

When all of the binned counts on which a median is based are zeroes, it is 
impossible to compute a valid median. Where this occurs, we leave the
median value blank.

When the interpolated median value fell into the lowest or highest count bin, 
we recoded the reported median using the values shown below. An observation that 
takes one of these values should be interpreted not as the median value itself, 
but as an indicator that the median was above or below the indicated bin 
boundary. This is also described on page 18 (PDF page 31) of the 1980 STF1 
Technical Documentation.

Median top and bottom codes:

	Table NT11A:
		<1.0: 0.9
		>85 : 85.1

	Table NT11B:
		<1.0: 0.9
		>85 : 85.1

	Table NT31:
		<1.1: 1.0
		>5.5: 5.6

	Table NT34:
		<1.01: 1.0
		>5.5 : 5.51

	Table NT39:
		<10000 : 9990
		>200000: 200100

	Table NT44:
		<50 : 49
		>500: 501

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppression
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data from 1980 STF1 include suppression, whereby certain counts for blocks with
few people or households were not published. When aggregating data from block parts
to whole blocks, we suppress data for a given variable whenever at least one of 
the component block parts had suppressed data for that variable.

Suppressed values are indicated with blanks, but not all blank values are due to 
suppression; we also leave median variables blank when they are not calculable from
the available count data.

You can use the SUPFLG fields to help determine whether a value is suppressed 
or not. For more information, see the 1980 STF1 Technical Documentation: 
https://assets.nhgis.org/original-data/modern-census/1980STF1.pdf

We'll remove some very small HDs for the next part (like HDs that are a single circle):

```{r}
# Drop some very small HDs that are like a single circle
# We just dropped anything smaller than 10 acres

  hd_shp %>%
  filter(!(LABEL %in% c("Emerald St HD",
                       "Grant Rd HD",
                       "Mount Vernon Triangle HD",
                       "Grant Circle HD",
                       "Union Market"
                       )))

```




# Demographic change analysis

Now let's look and see how HDs changed over time, in terms of % black residents and % white residents, compared to nearby neighborhoods (groups of blocks) that were not in HDs.

This will have a few steps:

1. Take a given HD.
2. Get the intersection of the HD with census tracts (in 1960) and blocks (in 1970 to 2020). If at least X% of the census tract area is in the HD, we'll count it as part of the HD.
3. Create a buffer around the HD of distance Y. Run another intersection with the census tracts/blocks and that buffer. Count any tracts/blocks that touch the buffer but are not in an HD as comparison tracts. 
4. Note the % of white and black residents in each HD and those HDs comparison tracts/blocks.
5. See how those respective percentages change over time. 



Function to find which tracts/blocks are in which HDs:

```{r}
# Get geographic units (tracts/blocks) within Historic Districts and calculate summary statistics
get_geos_in_hd <- function(shp, min_pct, year) {
  # Function parameters:
  #' @param shp: the tract or block shapefile (an sf shapefile object) containing demographic data

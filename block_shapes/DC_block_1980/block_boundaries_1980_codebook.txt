Derivation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary source for IPUMS NHGIS 1980 census block boundaries is the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s 1992 TIGER/Line Files. These TIGER/Line files include block boundaries for
both the 1990 and 1980 censuses, but the 1980 block definitions are badly incomplete
and often inaccurate. Approximately 765,000 of the 2.5 million blocks that appear 
in 1980 census summary tables do not appear in the 1992 TIGER/Line files. 

Using the 1980 paper census block maps as a guide, NHGIS staff manually edit data 
from the 1992 TIGER/Line Files to recover as many missing blocks as possible.  
NHGIS validates the edited geographic block data against the statistical block data 
from 1980 Summary Tape File 1 (STF1). For a small number of blocks that appear in 
STF1, we are unable to find corresponding blocks on the paper maps, so we cannot 
provide complete block definitions for all reported statistics. Our validation 
process produces summaries of the discrepancies between the edited boundary data 
and statistical data. We supply these summaries for user reference in two comma-separated
values (CSV) files along with each statewide shapefile.

Supplemental Files

"<state>_data_missing_polygon.csv"
    - Lists blocks that have records in the statistical tables but do not have 
      polygons in the shapefile. These blocks had no polygons in the 1992 TIGER/Line 
      files, and editors were unable to find them on the paper maps, even after 
      (in most cases) a second review. 

"<state>_polygon_missing_data.csv"
    - Lists blocks that have polygons in the shapefile but do not have records in 
      the statistical tables. 

Both files are limited to blocks that are included in this release of the 1980 block 
shapefiles, which may not include all blocks in the state.
